<i>We follow these principles:</i>
</font>

<p><font size="+2">
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer<br>
through early and continuous delivery<br>
of valuable software.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Welcome changing requirements, even late in <br>
development. Agile processes harness change for <br>
the customer's competitive advantage.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Deliver working software frequently, from a <br>
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a <br>
preference to the shorter timescale.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Business people and developers must work <br>
together daily throughout the project.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Build projects around motivated individuals. <br>
Give them the environment and support they need, <br>
and trust them to get the job done.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The most efficient and effective method of <br>
conveying information to and within a development <br>
team is face-to-face conversation.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Agile processes promote sustainable development. <br>
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able <br>
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Continuous attention to technical excellence <br>
and good design enhances agility.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount <br>
of work not done--is essential.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
The best architectures, requirements, and designs <br>
emerge from self-organizing teams.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+2">
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how <br>
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts <br>
its behavior accordingly.
